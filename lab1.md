## 1. Verify Confluent Cloud Resources
Let's verify if all resources were created correctly and we can start using them.

### Kafka Topics
Check if the following topics exist in your Kafka cluster:
 * shoe_products (for product data aka Product Catalog),
 * shoe_customers (for customer data aka Customer CRM),
 * shoe_orders (for realtime order transactions aka Billing System).

### Schemas in Schema Registry
Check if the following Avro schemas exist in your Schema Registry:
 * shoe_products-value,
 * shoe_customers-value,
 * shoe_orders-value.

NOTE: Schema Registry is at the Environment level and can be used for multiple Kafka clusters.

### Datagen Connectors
Your Kafka cluster should have three Datagen Source Connectors running. Check if their topic and template configurations match the table below.

| Connector Name (can be anything)     |      Topic      | Format |             Template | 
|--------------------------------------|:---------------:|-------:|---------------------:|
| **DatagenSourceConnector_products**  |  shoe_products  |   AVRO |            **Shoes** | 
| **DatagenSourceConnector_customers** | shoe_customers  |   AVRO |  **Shoes customers** | 
| **DatagenSourceConnector_orders**    |   shoe_orders   |   AVRO |     **Shoes orders** | 

## 2. Create Pool

### Create Flink Compute Pool
Create a Flink Compute Pool in environment `handson-flink`. Now go back to environment `handson-flink` and choose the `Flink` Tab. From there we create a new compute pool:
* choose a cloud region, click `continue` and 
* enter Pool Name: `cc_flink_compute_pool` with 10 Confluent Flink Units (CFU) and 
* click `Continue` button and then `Finish`.
* 
The pool will be provisioned and ready to use in a couple of moments.
AWS Pools take 1-2 minutes. Azure Pools can take 5-7 minutes.

## 3. Connecting to Flink 
You can use your web browser or console to enter Flink SQL statements.
  * **Web UI** - from the Home page click on the `Stream Processing` on the left side navigation
    Select you environment `handson-flink` and click button 'Create workspace'
    - select your cloud provider and region you want to use
    - click 'Create workspace'

    ![image](terraform/img/flinkCreateWorkspace.png)


  * **Console** - copy/paste the command from your Flink Compute Pool to the command line.    
  Of course you could also use the the Flink SQL Shell. For this, you need to have Confluent Cloud Console tool installed and be logged in with correct access rights.
  Copy the command out of the Compute Pool Window and execute it in your terminal (we prefer iterm2). 

  ```bash
  confluent flink shell --compute-pool <pool id> --environment <env-id>
  ```

NOTE: You can also access your Flink Compute Pool from the Data Portal as shown below. Just click on `Data Portal` in the main menu on the left side. Then select your Environment. You should see your topics. When you click on any of the topic tiles you can query the topic's data using Flink. 

Data Portal: `shoe_order` topic selected. Click on `Query` button to access your Flink Compute Pool.

## 4. Flink Tables
Let's start with exploring our Flink tables.
Kafka topics and schemas are always in sync with our Flink cluster. Any topic created in Kafka is visible directly as a table in Flink, and any table created in Flink is visible as a topic in Kafka. Effectively, Flink provides a SQL interface on top of Confluent Cloud.

Following mappings exist:
| Kafka          | Flink     | 
| ------------   |:---------:|
| Environment    | Catalog   | 
| Cluster        | Database  |
| Topic + Schema | Table     |

We will now work with the following SQL Worksheet:

![image](terraform/img/sql_worksheet.png)

Make sure you work with the correct Flink catalog (=environment) and database (=Kafka cluster).
 ![image](terraform/img/sqlWorksheetDetail.png)

If you are using console client you need to select your catalog and database:
```
USE CATALOG <MY CONFLUENT ENVIRONMENT NAME>;
```
```
USE <MY CONFLUENT KAFKA CLUSTER NAME>;
```

Check if you can see your catalog (=Environment) and databases (=Kafka Clusters):
```
SHOW CATALOGS;
```
```
SHOW DATABASES;
```

List all Flink Tables (=Kafka topics) in your Confluent Cloud cluster:
```
SHOW TABLES;
```
Do you see tables `shoe_products`, `shoe_customers`, `shoe_orders`?

![image](terraform/img/show_tables.png)

You can add multiple query boxes by clicking the `+` button on the left.

![image](terraform/img/add-query-box.png)

Understand how the table `shoe_products` was created:
```
SHOW CREATE TABLE shoe_products;
```

![image](terraform/img/sqlWorkspace_showCreated.png)

You can find more information about all parameters  [here.](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/flink/reference/statements/create-table.html)

### 5. Select Queries
Our Flink tables are populated by the Datagen connectors.

Let us first check the table schema for our `shoe_products` catalog. This should be the same as the topic schema in Schema Registry.
```
DESCRIBE shoe_products;
```

Let's check if any product records exist in the table.
```
SELECT * FROM shoe_products;
```

Now check if the `shoe_customers` schema  exists. 
```
DESCRIBE shoe_customers;
```

Are there any customers in Texas whose name starts with `B` ?
```
SELECT * FROM shoe_customers
  WHERE `state` = 'Texas' AND `last_name` LIKE 'B%';
```

Check all attributes of the `shoe_orders` table including hidden attributes. This will show regular DESCRIBE and system columns.
```
DESCRIBE EXTENDED shoe_orders;
```

Check the first ten orders for one customer.
```
SELECT order_id, product_id, customer_id, $rowtime
  FROM shoe_orders
  WHERE customer_id = 'b523f7f3-0338-4f1f-a951-a387beeb8b6a'
  LIMIT 10;
```

### 6. Aggregations
Let's try to run more advanced queries.

First find out the number of customers records and then the number of unique customers.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(id) AS num_customers FROM shoe_customers;
```

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id) AS num_customers FROM shoe_customers;
```

We can try some basic aggregations with the product catalog records.
For each shoe brand, find the number of shoe models, the average rating and the maximum model price. 

```sql
SELECT brand as brand_name, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT name) as models_by_brand, 
    ROUND(AVG(rating),2) as avg_rating,
    MAX(sale_price)/100 as max_price
FROM shoe_products
GROUP BY brand;
```


NOTE: You can find more information about Flink aggregations functions [here.](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/flink/reference/functions/aggregate-functions.html)

### 7. Time Windows

Let's try Flink's time windowing functions for shoe order records.
Column names “window_start” and “window_end” are commonly used in Flink's window operations, especially when dealing with event time windows.

Find the amount of orders for one minute intervals (tumbling window aggregation).

```sql
SELECT
 window_end,
 COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS num_orders
FROM TABLE(
   TUMBLE(TABLE shoe_orders, DESCRIPTOR(`$rowtime`), INTERVAL '1' MINUTES))
GROUP BY window_start, window_end;
```

Find the amount of orders for ten minute intervals advanced by five minutes (hopping window aggregation).

```sql
SELECT
 window_start, window_end,
 COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS num_orders
FROM TABLE(
   HOP(TABLE shoe_orders, DESCRIPTOR(`$rowtime`), INTERVAL '5' MINUTES, INTERVAL '10' MINUTES))
GROUP BY window_start, window_end;
```

NOTE: You can find more information about Flink Window aggregations [here.](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/flink/reference/queries/window-tvf.html)

### 8. Tables with Primary Key 

When you define a primary key in Flink SQL, you specify one or more columns in a table that uniquely identify each row. This is particularly important in streaming scenarios, where state must be correctly maintained.

Let's create a new table to deduplicate records from our customers stream.

```sql
CREATE TABLE <PREFIX>_shoe_customers_keyed(
  customer_id STRING,
  first_name STRING,
  last_name STRING,
  email STRING,
  PRIMARY KEY (customer_id) NOT ENFORCED
  );
```

 * customer_id is defined as the primary key
 * PRIMARY KEY (customer_id) NOT ENFORCED specifies the primary key constraint. In Flink SQL, primary keys are currently not enforced by default due to the challenges of ensuring uniqueness across distributed systems. The NOT ENFORCED clause reflects this, indicating that while the primary key is used for optimizations and correct processing, it does not guarantee data uniqueness constraints as a traditional database might.

```bash
SHOW CREATE TABLE shoe_customers_keyed;
```

We do have a different [changelog.mode](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/flink/reference/statements/create-table.html#changelog-mode) and a [primary key](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/flink/reference/statements/create-table.html#primary-key-constraint) constraint. What does this mean?

NOTE: You can find more information about changelog mode [here.](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/flink/concepts/dynamic-tables.html#changelog-entries)

Create a new Flink job to copy customer records from the original table to the new table.

```sql
INSERT INTO shoe_customers_keyed
  SELECT id, first_name, last_name, email
    FROM shoe_customers;
```

Show the amount of customers in `shoe_customers_keyed`.
```
SELECT COUNT(*) as AMOUNTROWS FROM shoe_customers_keyed;
```

Look up one specific customer (change the id if needed):

```sql
SELECT * 
 FROM shoe_customers_keyed  
 WHERE customer_id = 'b523f7f3-0338-4f1f-a951-a387beeb8b6a';
```

Compare it with all customer records for one specific customer:

```sql
SELECT *
 FROM shoe_customers
 WHERE id = 'b523f7f3-0338-4f1f-a951-a387beeb8b6a';
```

We also need to deduplicate records for our product catalog.

Prepare a new table that will store unique products only:

```sql
CREATE TABLE shoe_products_keyed(
  product_id STRING,
  brand STRING,
  `model` STRING,
  sale_price INT,
  rating DOUBLE,
  PRIMARY KEY (product_id) NOT ENFORCED
  );
```

Create a new Flink job to copy product data from the original table to the new table. 

```sql
INSERT INTO shoe_products_keyed
  SELECT id, brand, `name`, sale_price, rating 
    FROM shoe_products;
```

Check if only a single record is returned for some product.

```sql
SELECT * 
 FROM shoe_products_keyed  
 WHERE product_id = '0fd15be0-8b95-4f19-b90b-53aabf4c49df';
```

### 9. Flink Jobs 

Now, you can finally check which jobs are still running, which jobs failed, and which stopped. Go to `Flink (New)` in environments and choose `Flink Statements`. Check what you can do here.
![image](terraform/img/flink_jobs.png)

You can also  use the Confluent CLI (replace cloud and region values as needed):

```bash
confluent login
confluent flink statement list --cloud aws --region eu-central-1 --environment <your env-id> --compute-pool <your pool id>
